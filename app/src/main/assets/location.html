        <h2>Regions with Higher Leukemia Rates</h2>
        <p>
            Leukemia occurs worldwide, but certain regions have reported higher prevalence due to
            environmental, genetic, and lifestyle factors. Below are some areas where leukemia is more commonly reported.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>North America:</strong> The United States and Canada have relatively high rates, particularly among adults over 60.</li>
            <li><strong>Europe:</strong> Western and Northern European countries report higher incidences, often attributed to improved detection and aging populations.</li>
            <li><strong>Australia & New Zealand:</strong> These regions have some of the worldâ€™s highest leukemia survival rates, due to strong healthcare systems and early detection.</li>
            <li><strong>East Asia:</strong> Japan and South Korea have reported increasing leukemia cases, possibly due to industrial exposure and aging demographics.</li>
            <li><strong>Middle East:</strong> Some regions report rising cases, likely due to changes in diagnostic access and population awareness.</li>
            <li><strong>Developing Nations:</strong> Many African and South Asian countries have lower reported rates, which may be due to underdiagnosis rather than true prevalence.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="note">
        <strong>Note:</strong> The prevalence of leukemia varies by type (acute lymphoblastic, acute myeloid, chronic lymphocytic, etc.) and by factors such as age, genetics, and exposure to certain chemicals or radiation.

        <h2>Global Efforts</h2>
        <p>
            Organizations like the <strong>World Health Organization (WHO)</strong> and national cancer institutes
            are continuously collecting data to understand leukemia patterns and develop prevention strategies
            worldwide. Improved diagnosis and awareness campaigns are helping bridge the gap in reporting
            and treatment between countries.
